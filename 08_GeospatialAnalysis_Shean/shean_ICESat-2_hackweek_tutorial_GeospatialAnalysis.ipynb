    "# ICESat GLAS Background\n",
    "The NASA Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite ([ICESat](https://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/icesat/)) was a NASA mission carrying the Geosciences Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) instrument: a space laser, pointed down at the Earth (and unsuspecting Earthlings).  \n",
    "\n",
    "It measured surface elevations by precisely tracking laser pulses emitted from the spacecraft at a rate of 40 Hz (a new pulse every 0.025 seconds).  These pulses traveled through the atmosphere, reflected off the surface, back up through the atmosphere, and into space, where some small fraction of that original energy was received by a telescope on the spacecraft.  The instrument electronics precisely recorded the time when these intrepid photons left the instrument and when they returned.  The position and orientation of the spacecraft was precisely known, so the two-way traveltime (and assumptions about the speed of light and propagation through the atmosphere) allowed for precise forward determination of the spot on the Earth's surface (or cloud tops, as was often the case) where the reflection occurred.  The laser spot size varied during the mission, but was ~70 m in diameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "ICESat collected billions of measurements from 2003 to 2009, and was operating in a \"repeat-track\" mode that sacrificed spatial coverage for more observations along the same ground tracks over time.  One primary science focus involved elevation change over the Earth's ice sheets.  It allowed for early measurements of full Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet elevation change, which offered a detailed look at spatial distribution and rates of mass loss, and total ice sheet contributions to sea level rise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There were problems with the lasers during the mission, so it operated in short campaigns lasting only a few months to prolong the full mission lifetime.  While the primary measurements focused on the polar regions, many measurements were also collected over lower latitudes, to meet other important science objectives (e.g., estimating biomass in the Earth's forests, observing sea surface height/thickness over time).

    "# Sample GLAS dataset for CONUS\n",
    "A few years ago, I wanted to evaluate ICESat coverage of the Continental United States (CONUS).  The primary application was to extract a set of accurate control points to co-register a large set of high-resolution DEMs derived from satellite stereo imagery.  I wrote some Python/shell scripts to download, filter, and process all of the GLAH14 granules in parallel ([https://github.com/dshean/icesat_tools](https://github.com/dshean/icesat_tools)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The high-level workflow is here: https://github.com/dshean/icesat_tools/blob/master/glas_proc.py#L24.  These tools processed each H5 file and wrote out csvs of “good” points, then concatenated, to prepare the input csv (`GLAH14_tllz_conus_lulcfilt_demfilt.csv`) that we will use for this tutorial.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The csv contains ICESat GLAS shots that passed the following filters:\n",
    "* Within some buffer (~110 km) of mapped glacier polygons from the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI)\n",
    "* Returns from exposed bare ground (31) or snow/ice (12) according to a 30-m Land-use/Land-cover dataset (2011 NLCD, https://www.mrlc.gov/data?f%5B0%5D=category%3Aland%20cover)\n",
    "* Elevation values within some threshold (200 m) of elevations sampled from an external reference DEM (void-filled 1/3-arcsec [30-m] SRTM-GL1), used to remove spurious points and returns from clouds.\n",
    "* Various other ICESat-specific quality flags (see comments in `glas_proc.py` for details)\n",
    "\n",
    "The final file contains a relatively small subset (~65K) of the total shots in the original GLAH14 data granules from the full mission timeline (2003-2009).  The remaining points should represent returns from the Earth's surface with reasonably high quality, and can be used for subsequent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the coverage/quality was often insufficient for the co-registration process.  Last year, I decided to take another look at the sample of ICESat GLAS points over CONUS glaciers."

    "In 2D, transforming (x,y) coordinates between different projections (e.g., WGS84 vs. Albers Equal Area) on the same reference ellipsoid is pretty straightforward.  Things start to get more complicated when you include different ellipsoid models, horizontal/vertical datums, etc.  Oh, also the Earth's surface is not static - plate tectonics make everything more complicated, as time becomes important, and transformations must include a \"kinematic\" component.  \n",

    "Fortunately, the PROJ library (https://proj4.org/about.html) has generalized much of the complicated math for geodetic coordinate transformations.  It's been under development since the 1980s, and our understanding of the Earth's shape and plate motions has changed dramatically in that time period.  So, still pretty complicated, and there are different levels of support/sophistication in the tools/libraries that use PROJ (like fiona or GeoPandas).\n",

It is neither isometric nor area-preserving: that is, it preserves neither distances nor the areas of figures.\" [Wikipedia]\n",

This means that area and distance distortion will increase as you move away from this latitude.  So areas or distances measured near the pole will not be equivalent to areas or distances measured on the Antarctic Peninsula.  The difference isn't huge, but is nontrivial (~4-7% for Greenland and ~1-2% for Antarctica I believe).  See https://nsidc.org/data/polar-stereo/ps_grids.html for more details.\n",
